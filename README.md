# Explainable-AI

This project was created as part of my master's thesis on explainable AI.

The dataset that was used for this project is called Give Me Some Credit(GMC), taken from Kaggle. It has 150 000 observations and 11 variables. More specifically, 1 dependent variable and 10 independent variables.

This repository consists of 4 main folders.  An EDA and Pre-processing folder, a folder in which 3 black box classification models (RF, XGB, MLP) are constructed and a folder in which a collection of state-of-the-art explanation methods have been employed to crack open the black box of each of the models. Methods include LIME, SHAP, ANCHORS, CF, PDP, ICE plots, etc.
