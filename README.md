# Explainable-AI

This project was created as part of my master's thesis on explainable AI.

The dataset that was used for this project is called Give Me Some Credit(GMC), taken from Kaggle.

Three machine learning models were constructed (MLP, RF and XGB), and then multiple explanation methods were applied in order to crack open the black-box of these machine learning models. Explanation methods used in this research are LIME, anchors, counterfactual explanations, SHAP, PDP, ICE plots and ALE plots.
