# Explainable-AI

This project was created as part of my master's thesis on explainable AI.

The dataset that was used for this project is called Give Me Some Credit(GMC), taken from Kaggle.

This repository consists of 3 main folders.  An EDA folder, a pre-processing folder and a folder in which 3 black-box classification models (MLP, RF, XGB) are constructed and then explained using state-of-the-art explanation methods. Methods employed to crack open the black-box models include LIME, Anchors, DiCE (counterfactual explanations), SHAP, PDP, ICE plots and ALE plots.
